# SIEM-Honeypot-Home-Lab
<h2>Failed RDP to IP Geolocation Information</h2>


 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYCqmv3kXgY)


<h2>Description</h2>
<b> In this lab, I have been tasked with helping connect a office network for a small insurance agency. The office has two wired PC's that need to be connected to the network. My job will be to connect the devices, implement a basic configuration, and verify connectivity. 
</b>
<br />
<br />
The script is used in this demo where I setup Azure Sentinel (SIEM) and connect it to a live virtual machine acting as a honey pot.
We will observe live attacks (RDP Brute Force) from all around the world. I will use a custom PowerShell script to
look up the attackers Geolocation information and plot it on an Azure Sentinel Map!
